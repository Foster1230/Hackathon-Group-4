# Hackathon-Group-4
hello
use random number generater to deal cards
buttons to ask for more cards, Ace to 1 or 11
if we are using images for cards, must show to 1 player but not the rest
score to show wins, but probably not losses
a score that has an if statement that would be an automatic lose if it goes beyond 21
21 are insta wins
if more than one player get 21, goes to tie breaker
add more if needed
