# Hackathon-Group-4
hello
use random number generater to deal cards
buttons to ask for more cards, Ace to 1 or 11
if we are using images for cards, must show to 1 player but not the rest
score to show wins, but probably not losses
a score that has an if statement that would be an automatic lose if it goes beyond 21
21 are insta wins
if more than one player get 21, goes to tie breaker
add more if needed

make sure to remove anything betting related
randomize the cards so that its different everytime a player plays against the dealer
add any blackjack rules that could work
make sure that one card in the dealers hand is always hiddin until the end of the game
you can add a win and loss score if you want to
add the win lose condition

html
show the value of the card on screen
the hidden card the dealer has could show --
can we please change the background color
show the wins and loses on one side of the screen
the value of the card needs to stand out form the background so that it could be visual

remember, when the html is pushed it needs to work well with the code
change parts of the code/html if needed so it can work
we should put a play again button so playeres can try their luck again
add a feature that could change an Ace to either 1 or 11
I'll try my best to approve any changes/pull requests you guys do

the game itself
it would be easier if we put just the value of the card and leave the hidden card the dealer has as --
however if you guys want to do images included with the cards we need to get the card images and add the value so that it could add up
if the player goes over 21 its an instant lose
we would also need an image of the back of the card for the hidden card
