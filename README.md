# Hackathon-Group-4
hello
use random number generater to deal cards
buttons to ask for more cards, Ace to 1 or 11
if we are using images for cards, must show to 1 player but not the rest
score to show wins, but probably not losses
a score that has an if statement that would be an automatic lose if it goes beyond 21
21 are insta wins
if more than one player get 21, goes to tie breaker
add more if needed

make sure to remove anything betting related
randomize the cards so that its different everytime a player plays against the dealer
add any blackjack rules that could work
make sure that one card in the dealers hand is always hiddin until the end of the game
you can add a win and loss score if you want to
add the win lose condition
